\arguments{
\item{input}{Shiny's input object.}

\item{output}{Shiny's output object.}

\item{clarion}{A clarion object. See \code{\link[wilson]{Clarion}}. (Supports reactive)}

\item{multiple}{Whether or not textual ORs should allow multiple selections. (Fills vector sequentially if needed)(Supports reactive)}

\item{contains}{Whether or not textual ORs are initialized as textInput checking entries for given string. (Fills vector sequentially if needed)(Supports reactive)}

\item{ranged}{Whether or not numeric ORs are ranged. (Fills vector sequentially if needed)(Supports reactive)}

\item{step}{Set numeric ORs number of slider steps. (Fills vector sequentially if needed)(Supports reactive)}

\item{truncate}{Truncate datatable entries at x characters (Default = 30).}
